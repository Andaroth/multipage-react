# Multipage-React

## Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

An exercice I made to improve my React skills.  

I used `react-router-dom` to enable content routing. 

The great `materialize-react` is also used in this project. 

## Deployment

I'm using `gh-pages` to publish the React App on Github Pages.
